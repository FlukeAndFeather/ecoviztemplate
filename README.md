This is the use case template for the EcoViz+AI workshop.

## How to use the template

This should be done once by the project lead. After the project lead creates their copy of the repository on GitHub, everyone else in the group will create their own fork.

### Clone locally

To use this template, clone this repo and rename it.

From the directory where you keep git repositories (e.g., ~/Documents/GitHub/), run this command.

> `git clone https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/ecoviztemplate.git [your repo name]` 

Make sure to replace `[your repo name]` with the repo name you've chosen for your use case. Otherwise it'll be called "ecoviztemplate".

### Push to GitHub

Create a remote repository on GitHub with the same name.

Then, back at the command line, run this command (replacing the username and repo name).

> `git remote add origin https://github.com/[your username]/[your repo name].git`

Then push your local to the remote.

> `git push -u origin main`
