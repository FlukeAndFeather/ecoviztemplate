`notebooks/`

This folder should contain literate programming files. That usually means Jupyter notebooks for Python and RMarkdown/Quarto documents for R.

* Notebooks should explain how your pipeline works.
* Text explanations, visualizations, and sample code are ideal.
* Long-running operations (e.g., data downloads, model fitting) should go in other scripts so notebooks can render quickly.
