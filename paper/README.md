`paper/`

This folder contains the manuscript for your use case. It can be a Markdown document, but preferably a literate programming document (e.g., Jupyter or Quarto). 

* Long-running operations (e.g., data downloads, model fitting) should go in pipeline scripts so the paper can render quickly.
* Use the contents of `output/` to reduce rendering times.
