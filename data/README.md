`data/` contains raw data for the analysis.

The contents of this folder will not sync to GitHub. Use this README to document the analysis' raw data. Make sure to record the following two characteristics.

1.  The exact folder and file structure of `data/`.
2.  Where to find the data externally.
  -   Ideally, you have a script that automates the data download process (if possible).

Important considerations for `data/`.

-   Never edit these data manually.
-   Don't put derived data (i.e., outputs from your pipeline) here; those go in `output`.
-   Code doesn't go here, just data.
